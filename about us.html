<h3><p align="justify">OUR LOGO
The "MI" in our logo stands for �Mobile Internet�. It also has other meanings, including "Mission Impossible", because Xiaomi faced many challenges that
had seemed impossible to defy in our early days.
Redmi is a sub-brand owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. It was introduced as a budget smartphone line manufactured by Xiaomi, that was first announced in July 2013.[1] It became a sub-brand, separated from Xiaomi, on January 10, 2019. Redmi phones use the Xiaomi MIUI user interface on top of Android. Models can be divided into regular Redmi phones with screens usually up to 5" and Redmi Note series with displays exceeding 5". Only phone besides these two series is Redmi Pro, first introduced in 2016 with Dual Camera system, USB-C and unique for Xiaomi devices OLED display. Redmi A have been marketed in several Asian and European countries.The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that it uses less-expensive components and thus is more cost-effective. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year Xiaomi smartphone shipment rankings in China with a market share of 14%.<sup>[2]</sup> Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.<sup>[2]</sup></h3></p>

<h3><p align="justify">Xiaomi produces many products. Notably, it produces smartphones which run on their own version of Android MIUI firmware. Observers suggest that part of Xiaomi's rapid success rests on its ability to differentiate itself within the Android universe.<sup>[19][need quotation to verify]</sup> The company has increased its range of products; its smartphones include: Mi Series, Mi Note Series, Mi Max Series, Mi Mix Series and the Redmi Series. As well as mobile phones, Xiaomi has started selling wearables, mobile accessories, and appliances such as television and speakers. In 2018 it was selling tablets, laptops, and smart-home devices.</p>

<p align="justify">Xiaomi operates on a vertically-integrated model that enables the company to sell hardware at cost or below in order to attract users and earn money by selling content.<sup>[19]</sup> Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who served Xiaomi's vice president from 2014 to 2017, characterized the organization as "an Internet and a software company much more than a hardware company".<sup>[20]</sup></p>

<img src="Xiaomi_Redmi_Note.jpg" size width="300px" size height="300px" align="right" hspace="50" vspace"50">  
<p align="justify">Xiaomi also keeps its prices low or close to "bill-of-material" by keeping most of its products in the market longer, eighteen months rather than the six-month norm followed by many smartphone companies.<sup>[20]</sup> This strategy allows Xiaomi to take advantage of price reductions in the prices of key components of its products. It enables the company to sell hardware with specifications comparable to high-end devices at a fraction of the cost.<sup>[21][need quotation to verify]</sup>

The company's version of the Android operating system, the MIUI skin, with its design, app marketplace, and functionalities, has established a community of users<sup>[19]</sup> who form a crucial part of Xiaomi's customer base and contribute to the company's drive for market awareness. This ecosystem is a massive source of revenue as indicated in 2015, when sales from the platform reached $750 million.<sup>[22]</sup>

<p align="justify">The company focuses on India, the world's second-largest smartphone market <sup>[23][24]</sup>. Xiaomi announced on May 2, 2018, the launch of Mi Music and Mi Video to offer "value-added internet services" in India <sup>[25]</sup>. On March 22, 2017, Xiaomi announced that it planned to set up a second manufacturing unit in India in partnership with contract manufacturer Foxconn.<sup>[26][27]</sup> On August 7, 2018, Xiaomi announced on its blog <sup>[28]</sup> that Holitech Technology Co. Ltd., Xiaomi's top supplier, would invest up to $200 million over the next three years to set up a major new plant in India. <sup>[29]</sup></p>

<p align="justify">Recently Xiaomi started to sell more simple goods such as sunglasses, caps, pillows, glass lunchboxes, cups, filters, bags, backpacks, luggages, screwdrivers, umbrellas and etc. <sup>[30]</sup></p></h3>
